# Kiltrr
## kiltrr-app-api :: The AWS Serverless implementation of the Kiltrr back-end.
*Elevator pitch tbd*.

This project is my first journey into Serverless. https://serverless-stack.com has been an invaluable source of learning for me, and most of the current structure can be attributed to their, quote, "guide to building full-stack apps with Serverless and React".

### Requirements :: Build and Deploy
The build and deploy machine must be running nodejs and python, with npm and pip. The Serverless npm and awscli pip packages must be installed globally. *More to come*.

### Requirements :: Database
This code relies on DynamoDB tables. *More to come*.
